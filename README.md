# ShogunChallenge

To run this application, do the following in the CLI:

1. npm i to download all the goodies
2. npm start to spin up the server
3. in another terminal, npm run dev to run the application

It should appear on your broswer on localhost:8080. I also wrote a few tests;
you can run them with npm test.

I left psuedocode throughout to explain my though process and code.
Please note in a production-level project this would be replaced by
actual documentation. Enjoy!
